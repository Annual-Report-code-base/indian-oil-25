                        During the year, we continued to strengthen the electronic Platform for IndianOil Customers (ePIC), our unified digital backbone that supports seamless transactions, CRM, logistics and self-service tools. The platform now facilitates daily deliveries of over 30 Lakh Indane LPG cylinders, generates upwards of 1,248 Lakh invoices for lubricants and enables avarage real-time redemption of over 6 Lakh Per Day loyalty reward point transactions. Our efforts to digitise customer journeys also include expanding the ‘Easy-Go facility’ for LPG connection transfers, integrating DAC (Delivery Authentication Code) with biometric verification in pilot locations and enhancing the IndianOil One App with smart notifications, refill tracking and grievance logging.

Each grievance is treated not just as a complaint, but as an opportunity to improve. Our training programmes for front-line personnel emphasise empathy, responsiveness and customer-centric problem-solving, ensuring that our last-mile engagement is as strong as our central systems.
