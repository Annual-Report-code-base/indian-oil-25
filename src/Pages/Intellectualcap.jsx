                        We commissioned the 300 KTPA indDSK® unit at Paradip Refinery to produce low-sulphur Pipeline Compatible Kerosene (PCK), enabling smooth pipeline transfers. At Bongaigaon Refinery, we successfully commissioned our mixed metal oxide-based IV-IZOMaxCat® catalyst, which delivered high isomerate yield and octane performance at reactor inlet temperatures of over 100°C, a notable improvement over the previous catalyst.

                        The Catalyst Manufacturing Unit (CMU) at Panipat Refinery commenced continuous production of FCC catalyst additives and hydrotreating catalysts. These are now meeting internal demand and enhancing our self-reliance in critical refining inputs. We also implemented advanced diagnostic systems for failure analysis and residual life assessment, strengthening the reliability of refinery and pipeline assets.

                    <p className=" mb-4">
                        To further support domestic capability building, we signed a Heads of Agreement with Süd-Chemie India Pvt. Ltd. (SCIL) to establish a Joint Venture Company for the manufacture and supply of INDMAX catalysts.

We also commercialised our in-house developed XtraFlo® Drag Reducing Agent (DRA), significantly reducing reliance on imported DRAs. XtraFlo® is now being supplied to other pipeline operators such as HPCL, BPCL and HMEL.

                                    participation is electronically recorded. On finalisation, award

                                    and shared with the selected vendor. These vendors are subsequently
                                    registered in IndianOil’s ERP system (SAP), which records details
                                    of delivered items, pricing, timelines and payment transactions.
