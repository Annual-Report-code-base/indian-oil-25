                    Stakeholders are enablers of our value creation journey and as such,
                    maintaining ongoing engagement with them is vital. Through meaningful
                    and continuous dialogue with our diverse stakeholder groups, we
                    strengthen our foundation and co-create pathways towards a more
                    sustainable and value-accretive future.
