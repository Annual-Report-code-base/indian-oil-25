                                    One of our innovative projects aims to produce ethanol from paddy straw, helping to create cleaner fuels and reduce stubble burning. We have also established a supply chain involving Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs), Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs) and individual farmers to collect baled paddy straw. Over 1.2 Lakh MT of biomass was gathered during the Kharif 2023 and 2024 seasons through depots in Karnal and Panipat. This initiative not only curbs stubble burning, but also generates income for farmers and supports the ethanol blending programme.

                            At our Haldia facility, we have pioneered a Green Sewage Treatment Plant using Integrated Wetland Technology (IWT), developed in collaboration with IIT Bombay. This system treats 8 cubic meters per hour (m³/hr) of domestic sewage in an eco-friendly and energy-efficient manner, showcasing our commitment to nature-based solutions and sustainable urban infrastructure.
